* Add **custom forms** to event sales pages using our easy form generator. Use this super powerful feature to collect additional information or provide upsells or addons. For example, **sell shwag** to an event so buyers can order the t-shirt etc at the same time they purchase tickets. Custom form fields can be single line text, multi-line text, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown list, or a file upload field, and each field can have an optional price assigned to it so that if a buyer selects something in the form with a price, that cost is added to the price of the ticket purchase during checkout. 

* Offer **ticket discount coupon codes**. Easily use the coupon features of WooCommerce to generate any number of coupons or discounts for an event

* Schedule times when you have **tickets on sale at discounted prices** - e.g. lower than the regular price. Sale prices start and end automatically based on the dates you assign in the event.

Then modify the template to suit your needs. You won't lose your changes when you upgrade the plugin. Note that this template file is also used by our WooEvents Pro ticketing plugin, if you have that installed. So if you currently sell tickets, or might do so in the future, be careful to take that into consideration when modifying the template.
