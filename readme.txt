**WooEvents™ Pro:**

*[WooEvents Pro](http://ignitewoo.com/woocommerce-extensions-plugins/wordpress-event-calendar-wooevents-pro-for-woocommerce/ " WooCommerce Event Ticketing Plugin - WooEvents ") extends the functionality of Event Calendar & Ticketing tremendously*.

Sell tickets, or not. Your choice. Either way, you gain the ability to create complex events itineraries and recurring events. 

If you opt to sell tickets then you gain a world of functionality. WooEvents Pro is quite possibly the best solution available today. It integrates *directly* with the free WooCommerce plugin, which means you easily gain a super powerful ticket selling platform capable of taking payment with over 100 different payment gateways.

All your ticketed events are fully configurable products in WooCommerce. 

*No hacks, no shims, no funky workarounds. Just straight up deep direct integration with WooCommerce.*

**With WooEvents Pro:**

* **5-star priority support via email and phone**

* Sell tickets using **over 100 different payment gateways** - any gateway supported by WooCommerce works with WooEvents Pro.

* Create **recurring events** on daily, weekly, monthly, or custom schedules

* Integrated **Google Calendar** export support for your event calendar

* Integrated **iCal export support** for you events calendar

* Includes a **mini-calendar widget** to display an events calendar anywhere you can place a widget

* Establish per-buyer **ticket quantity purchase limits** to thwart ticket scalpers

* Set up event **ticket variations** to sell specific seating, where each variation can have it's own stock quantity, regular price, and sale price. For example, set up an event that has 5 types of seating and sell each type in a different quantity and cost

* Set up limited quantity **tickets at special prices**. Example: Offer the first 10 ticket buyers a special discount on select seating by using ticket-related coupons or variation product quantities to limit availability

* Schedule **large events and conferences** with multiple sessions, multiple sponsors, and multiple speakers. Example: Easily create a multi-session event or conference where there might be many sessions and each session has 1 or more speakers - and optionally assign organizers and sponsors to those sessions, and/or the entire event or conference. Easily rearrange your complete event information with simple drag-and-drop functionality

* Allow buyers to **print their own tickets**, complete with **QR Codes**. The QR codes link directly to the customer's order page in the WordPress admin area or a mini check-in interface, so you can quickly get your guests checked in at the door.


* **Generate reports** of event attendees and related data to quickly get a view of who you're expecting to attend. Sort your report by any field in the report. Plus, you can print your reports or export them to CSV/Excel or PDF files.

* **Allow backorders** to create "**waiting lists**" 

* Add **custom forms** to event sales pages using our easy form generator. Use this super powerful feature to **collect additional information or provide upsells or addons**. For example, **sell shwag** to an event so buyers can order the t-shirt etc at the same time they purchase tickets. Custom form fields can be single line text, multi-line text, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdown list, or a file upload field, and each field can have an optional price assigned to it so that if a buyer selects something in the form with a price the cost is added to the price of the ticket purchase during checkout. 

* Offer **ticket discount coupon codes**. Easily use the coupon features of WooCommerce to generate any number of coupons or discounts for an event

* Schedule times when you have **tickets on sale at discounted prices** - e.g. lower than the regular price. Sale prices start and end automatically based on the dates you assign in the event. 

* Optionally manage regular non-ticket events and ticket-related events separately.

* Optionally display individual calendars for non-ticket events or ticket-related, or display a calendar with both types of events combined. 

* Don't want to sell tickets for a particular event? No problem, just publish the event in WooCommerce with an empty price. The event instantly becomes a full event listing with no purchase options.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get support? =

For support contact us directly via the Contact form on [IgniteWoo.com](http://ignitewoo.com/ " WooCommerce plugins and custom development "). Contacting us directly gets you a faster response, we don't have a lot of time available to check the WordPress support forums. Note that we do publish a support phone number on our Web site, however *phone support is only available for our paid plugins.*


= How do I report a bug? =

Same as a above, contact us directly

= How do I embed a calendar using a shortcode? =

Simply insert [ignitewoo_events_calendar] into any post or page where you want to the calendar to appear.

Alternatively, if you're using our WooEvents Pro plugin you can add parameters to the shortcode for displaying simple events, or ticket-related events, or both: 

Display a calendar that only shows events: 

*[events_calendar type="events"]*

Display a calendar that only shows events with tickets

*[events_calendar type="tickets"]*

Display a calendar with simple events and ticket-related events

*[events_calendar type="both"]*

WooEvents Pro ONLY: Display a calendar with ticket-related events from a specific product category, such as "Gold". Notice that the cat="gold" in the shortcode example below has lower case "gold" - this is the category slug. If you category name is "Gold Rings" then the slug would be "gold-rings". The cat parameter expects a single category slug. You can find the slugs by reviewing your product categories.

*[events_calendar type="tickets" cat="gold"]*

= How do I embed the event details using a shortcode? =

Use the shortcode *[event_details]*

= Can you add a new feature for me? =

It's certainly possible! Contact us and tell us what feature you're looking for. 

= How do I customize the event information template? =

Copy the file templates/ignitewoo-event-details-template.php into your theme directory into a subdirectory called "ignitewoo_events". Example: Copy templates/ignitewoo-event-details-template.php to wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME-DIR/ignitewoo_events/ignitewoo-event-details-template.php

Then modify the template to suit your needs. You won't lose your changes when you upgrade the plugin. Note that this template file is also used by our WooEvents Pro ticketing plugin, if you have that installed. So if you currently sell tickets, or might do so in the future, be careful to take that into consideration when modifying the template. 

= How do I customize the calendar CSS, widget CSS, and other event CSS? = 

Copy /assets/css/ignitewoo_events.css into your theme directory into a subdirectory called "ignitewoo_events". Example: Copy /assets/css/ignitewoo_events.css to wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME-DIR/ignitewoo_events/ignitewoo_events.css. AND copy  /assets/css/widgets.css to wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME-DIR/ignitewoo_events/widgets.css

Then modify the CSS to suit your needs.

= What is the text domain for translators? =

The text domain is "ignitewoo_events" 

The file name should be ignitewoo_events-en_US.mo where en_US is your langauge indicator.

Place your language files in the wp-content/languages subdirectory.
