== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get support? =

= How do I report a bug? =

Same as a above, contact us directly

= How do I embed a calendar using a shortcode? =

Simple insert [events_calendar] into any post or page where you want to the calendar to appear.

Alternatively, if you're using our WooEvents Pro plugin you can add parameters to the shortcode for displaying simple events, or ticket-related events, or both: 

Display a calendar that only shows events: 

*[events_calendar type="events"]*

Display a calendar that only shows events with tickets

*[events_calendar type="tickets"]*

Display a calendar with simple events and ticket-related events

*[events_calendar type="both"]*

= Can you add a new feature for me? =

It's certainly possible! Contact us and tell us what feature you're looking for. 

= How do I customize the event information template? =

Copy the file templates/ignitewoo-event-details-template.php into your theme directory into a subdirectory called "ignitewoo_events". Example: Copy templates/ignitewoo-event-details-template.php to wp-content/themes/YOUR-THEME-DIR/ignitewoo_events/ignitewoo-event-details-template.php

Then modify the template to suit your needs. You won't lose your changes when you upgrade the plugin. Note that this template file is also used by our WooEvents Pro ticketing plugin, if you have that installed. So if you currently sell tickets, or might do so in the future, be careful to take that into consideration when modifying the template.
